## Free sharing of information might be the ideal in science, but the reality is often more complicated. Normal practice today looks something like this:

A scientist collects some data and stores it on a machine that is occasionally backed up by their department.

They then write or modify a few small programs (which also reside on the machine) to analyze that data.

Once they have some results, they write them up and submit a paper. The scientist might include their data – a growing number of 
journals require this – but they probably don’t include the code.

Time passes.

The journal sends the scientist reviews written anonymously by a handful of other people in their field. The scientist revises the paper to satisfy the reviewers, during which time they might also modify the scripts they wrote earlier, and resubmits.

More time passes.

The paper is eventually published. It might include a link to an online copy of the data, but the paper itself will be behind a paywall: only people who have personal or institutional access will be able to read it.


## Keyword:

Open scientific work is more useful and more highly cited than closed.

A version control system is a tool that keeps track of these changes for us, effectively creating different versions of our files. It allows us to decide which changes will be made to the next version (each record of these changes is called a commit), and keeps useful metadata about them. The complete history of commits for a particular project and their metadata make up a repository. Repositories can be kept in sync across different computers, facilitating collaboration among different people.
